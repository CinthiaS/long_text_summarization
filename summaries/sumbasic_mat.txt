The dataset includes sequences from 20 of the 27 governorates  that were isolated from 20072012 from both human and avian hosts. We used a Bernoulli prior probability distribution in order to place an equal probability for inclusion or exclusion of each predictor , and set the prior success probability of the Bernoulli distribution such that there was a 50% prior probability that the model does not contain any predictor. The specific categories of avian populations provided by these resources are chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese/guinea fowl, and pigeons/other birds.
We identified all Los Angeles Fire Department paramedic transports of patients to UCLA Medical Center during the 12 month period from January to December 2005 in a prospectively maintained database. Dispatcher assigned MPDS codes for each of these patient transports were abstracted from the paramedic run sheets and compared to final hospital discharge diagnosis . Test performance characteristics were analyzed based on the directly measured number of true positives , false positives , and false negatives .
Because stress levels were low, we oversampled women with higher perceived stress scores. We then derived random sample of everyone else  for a final study sample size of 740. Family breast cancer history was parameterized to reflect potential stress due to increased burden of familial breast cancer risk; for this purpose, we created a variable summing the number of breast cancer cases in first degree relatives  plus the sum of occurrences of early onset breast cancer across the three generations .
All testing was performed at early  and delayed  recovery stages, except for fear conditioning and extinction studies where only the 7d delayed recovery time point was assessed, due to temporal overlap of 16 h extinction and 7 d conditioning experiments that needed to be performed within the same context . Physiological measures from separate cohorts exposed to behavioral testing were not different from each other, so these data were pooled . Animals were allowed to recover from CVS for 7d, and were exposed to fear conditioning paradigm thereafter .
P0 was estimated from the sample of the first culture, Pt was typically estimated at least an hour later .

If the stripping potential is applied as a square wave, the technique is known as square wave stripping voltammetry. Classical amperometric and voltammetric EC methods have been attractive as analytical techniques because they offer detection limits on the order of 10−7−10−8 M, while stripping analysis preconcentrates solutes to achieve limits down to 10−10−10−11 M . These advances can be grouped into three EC technologies: screen printed electrodes, integrated nanomaterials, and EC immunoassays.
